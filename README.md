Hi all,

I'm a totally newcomer of Github or even the code world. I truely have been yearning for coding for a long time, but never set my mind to learn it. Now the world is experiencing the upside down change, brought by computer technology. We need to embrace the trend, and I'm sure joining GitHub will be the right choice!
